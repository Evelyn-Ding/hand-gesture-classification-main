# list to keep track of things
# function to do the math


# objective: create a time-domain graph that tracks the magnitude with respect to time (like tracking acceleration wrt time)
# the magnitude is the difference between two (x,y) coordinates between 2 frames
# magnitude is calculated as sqrt(x^2+y^2) and captures the change in the two points (as 1 Dimension)
# magnitude allows you to see how much the hands has moved in order to track the severity of the tremor
